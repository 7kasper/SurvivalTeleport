A way to teleport in survival minecraft that does not feel like cheating. Instead of running a command like /tpa the player has to create a special teleport clock that can be bound to another player and used later to teleport. The teleportation also uses some (3) XP levels so that it requires some work to teleport. 

## Crafting
The special teleport-clock is crafted as follows:

## Usage
1. After crafting the teleport-clock you need to bind it to a player first. This is done by hitting the player with the teleport-clock:

   _Note: you need the `survivalteleport.bind` permission in order to bind the clock. This permission is enabled on default._
3. The clock is now ready to be used. Hold it in your hand or off-hand and press crouch to hone the clock in:

   _Note: you need the `survivalteleport.use` permission in order to use the clock. This permission is enabled on default._
4. If you have enough (3) XP levels and the target player is online you will now teleport to them:

   _Note: The clock will be reset after a teleport. You need to hit the player again to bind it again._

## Use cases
The plugin was mainly intended for a survival-friendly alternative to `/tpa`-like commands. Considering you need chorus plants and activly need to invest in XP it is a late game item.  
You can use the clock to quickly get back to a friend, but you do need to plan ahead (in other words hit each other first).  
You can perhaps also use the item in combat. You need to get up close first and then you can ambush your opponent later.  
The item can be stored in any container so using it for later is not only possible but very useful.  
_Tip: you can combine it with [HoneyXP](https://github.com/7kasper/HoneyXp), a bed and a chest to get fast travel to a friend or foe after a death._
